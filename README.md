# Semantic Segmentation Architectures

## Description
This repository contais the implementation of Semantic Segmentation Deep Learning architectures
for the Computer Vision course. For more info about the course, please refer to its [website (in Portuguese)](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~cabm/visao/).

## Models
The following segmentation models are currently made available:

- [FCN](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf). This fully convolutional networks uses a VGG-style encoder to obtain a image representation for semantic segmentation.

- [Encoder-Decoder based on SegNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561). This fully convolutional network uses a VGG-style encoder-decoder, where the upsampling in the decoder is done using transposed convolutions.

- [Encoder-Decoder with skip connections based on SegNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561). This fully convolutional network uses a VGG-style encoder-decoder, where the upsampling in the decoder is done using transposed convolutions.
Also, it employs additive skip connections from the encoder to the decoder.
